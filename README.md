## Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my GitHub profile!! ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to look around and check out some of my available public repositories.

### Here are some projects I like to work on in my spare time:

- ðŸ“« I'm very interested in data science and game development. Right now I am learning Python!
- ðŸŒ± I started off learning Java and C# for developing games, and have used them to create some cool projects here.
- âš¡ My most recently published project here was evaluating goals that I set for myself from May '23 to Sep '23. I pinned the repo below if you would like to check it out. Pictures and explanations included!
