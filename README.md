### Hey! Thank you for taking the time to look at my GitHub profile!! ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to look around and check out some of my public repos available.

### Just some quick projects/ideas I like to work on in my spare time:

- ðŸ“« I'm currently interested in data analytics and game development. Right now I am learning Python and SQL!
- ðŸŒ± I started off learning Java and C#, and have used them to create some cool projects here!
- âš¡ My most recently finished project was evaluating several technology stocks for July - Dec 2022. I pinned the repo below if you would like to check it out. Pictures and explanations included!
- ðŸ’¬ A current project I am working on is creating visualizations for several occurrences of landslides throughout the world from 2007 - 2017. The repo is available, but will completed soon!
